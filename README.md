## Mobile-Flashcards

React Nanodegree final project - mobile flashcards app using React Native

### Description
I have build an Android application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. 

### How to run the App?

 
This application is build using a tool by Expo called 'create-react-native-app'
You need to have NodeJS and NPM to start it.
To run the application on your Android device, download the Expo app from the Google Play Store and scan the QR code which is displayed in the command.

npm install
npm start
